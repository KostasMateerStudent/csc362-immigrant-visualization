        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          We are interested in examining the trends of immigrant workers coming into the US
          over time. We are curious because Sathish is an international student himself, and 
          discovering the liklihood and trends with this immigration data can give him a greater 
          insight about what immigration to the US is like. Kostas is not an international student, 
          but his mom was an immigrant herself. It is important to us because we want to not only see 
          what the trends are, but what are some disparities found within the US immigration system.
        </p>
        <h4>Questions</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Which continents did the most nonimmigrant temporary workers come
            from in 2021 (workers and families)? Are some continents favored, or is it 
            a matter of absolute population numbers?
          </li>
          <li>
            What are the disparities between the admitted nonimmigrants into the
            US? Are certain countries favored, or, again, is it a matter of absolute population numbers?
          </li>
          <li>
            What was the effect of COVID on the the disparities between the
            admitted nonimmigrants into the US?
          </li>
          <li>
            Where are these nonimmigrants entering the United States, and why is that the case?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Dataset</h4>
        <p>
          The dataset is from the US Department of
          Homeland Security and it is the 2021 U.S. Nonimmigrant Admissions
          Annual Flow Report. It presents workload information on total
          nonimmigrant admissions and detailed data gathered from Form I-94
          arrival records on the number and characteristics of nonimmigrant
          admissions to the United States in Fiscal Year 2021. The dataset has
          multiple tables and is vast including the number of admissions over
          time, immigration status and country of origin.
