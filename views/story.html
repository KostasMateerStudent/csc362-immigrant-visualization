        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Our project aims to analyze the trends in nonimmigrant worker
          admissions to the United States over time. As an international
          student, Sathish has a personal interest in understanding the
          likelihood and trends of immigration to the US. On the other hand,
          Kostas' mother was an immigrant herself, giving him a unique
          perspective on the topic. Our project seeks to not only uncover the
          general trends but also investigate potential disparities within the
          US immigration system.
        </p>
        <h4>Questions</h4>
        <p>
          To gain deeper insights into the trends and disparities within the US
          immigration system, we will explore the following questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Which continents did the most nonimmigrant temporary workers come
            from in 2021 (workers and families)? Is it a matter of absolute
            population numbers or are some continents favored?
          </li>
          <li>
            What are the disparities between the admitted nonimmigrants into the
            US? Are certain countries favored or is it a matter of absolute
            population numbers?
          </li>
          <li>
            What was the effect of COVID-19 on the disparities between the
            admitted nonimmigrants into the US?
          </li>
          <li>
            Where are these nonimmigrants entering the United States, and what
            factors contribute to their choice of destination?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Dataset</h4>
        <p>
          Our analysis is based on the 2021 U.S. Nonimmigrant Admissions Annual
          Flow Report, obtained from the US Department of Homeland Security. The
          dataset provides comprehensive information on nonimmigrant admissions
          to the United States, including detailed data gathered from Form I-94
          arrival records on the number and characteristics of nonimmigrant
          admissions in Fiscal Year 2021. The dataset is vast and contains
          multiple tables, including information on the number of admissions
          over time, immigration status, and country of origin. Sure! In
          addition to the U.S. Nonimmigrant Admissions Annual Flow Report from
          the US Department of Homeland Security, we also used data from the
          World Bank to provide additional context for our analysis.
          Specifically, we obtained data on GDP per capita and population from
          the World Bank to explore potential correlations between a country's
          economic situation and the number of nonimmigrant temporary workers
          admitted to the US. By incorporating this additional data, we hoped to
          gain a deeper understanding of the factors that influence US
          immigration trends.
