## About
For our project, we want to examine the trends of immigrant workers coming into the US over time. 
The dataset is from the US Department of Homeland Security and it is the 2021 U.S. Nonimmigrant 
Admissions Annual Flow Report. It presents workload information on total 
nonimmigrant admissions and detailed data gathered from Form I-94 arrival records 
on the number and characteristics of nonimmigrant admissions to the United States in 
Fiscal Year 2021. The dataset has multiple tables and is vast including the number 
of admissions over time, immigration status and country of origin.
- Which continents did the most nonimmigrant temporary workers come from in 2021 (workers and families)?
- What are the disparities between the admitted nonimmigrants into the US?
- What was the effect of COVID on the the disparities between the admitted nonimmigrants into the US?
